# TodoMVC Application - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Application Overview

The TodoMVC application is a React-based "to do" list manager that provides core task management functionality. The
application features:

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, complete, and delete individual todos
- **Bulk Operations**: Mark all todos as complete/incomplete and clear all completed todos
- **Filtering**: View todos by All, Active, or Completed status
- **URL Routing**: Support for direct navigation to filtered views via URLs
- **Counter Display**: Real-time count of active (incomplete) todos
- **Persistence**: State maintained during session (browser refresh behavior not tested)

## Test Scenarios

#### 1.1 Add Valid "To-do"
**Steps:**
1. Click in the "What needs to be done?" input field
2. Type "Buy groceries"
3. Press Enter key

**Expected Results:**

- Input field is cleared and ready for next entry
- "To-do" list controls become visible (Mark all as complete checkbox)

**Quality Standards**:
- Write steps that are specific enough for any tester to follow
- Include negative testing scenarios

**Output Format**: please save the file as a markdown file (.md) inside src/test/java/Playwright/project/resources/JuniePlans
with a clear and descriptive name.
