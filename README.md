# Automation Practice Project using Playwright

This repository contains automated test scripts written in Java using Playwright. The tests are designed to practice and improve my skills in test automation, focusing on POM and cross-browser compatibility. Created by Daniel Pap - https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpap1999/

## Technologies Used

- **Java** – Programming language
- **Playwright** – Automation framework
- **Maven** – Automation tool
- **Page Object Model (POM)** – Design pattern for maintainable, scalable, and reusable tests

## Project Overview

This project serves as a personal practice suite to enhance my automation skills, including:

- Writing clean, maintainable tests using POM
- Utilising assertThat for easy-to-read, concise assertions
- Exploring API testing in general and using APIs to speed up tests
- Practicing a variety of Playwright commands for interacting with web elements

## Notes

This project is a work in progress, focused on learning and exploring different techniques
